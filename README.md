# Why does this exist?
Mainly because i got bored lol.<br>
But also because i disliked how the current programs i used behaved.<br>
So instead of fixing them i created my own!<br>

# Configuration
sysmenu can be configured in 2 ways<br>
1: By changing config.h and recompiling (Suckless style)<br>
2: Using launch arguments<br>

# Theming
sysmenu uses your gtk4 theme by default, However it can be also load custom css,<br>
Just copy the included menu.css file to ~/.config/sys64/menu.css<br>
